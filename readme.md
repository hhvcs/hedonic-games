### Hedonic Game Simulator

Go to
[lukemiles.org/hedonic-games/](http://lukemiles.org/hedonic-games/)
for a full explanation and to use the code.  This is public domain dedication,
so use anything as you wish. Please look through the javascript files, I tried
to make them very readable!

My friend Joshua Baunach and I originally made this software at CatHacks 2017
at the University of Kentucky. I've been expanding it since then.


**Current main goal: Switch to vis.js**
