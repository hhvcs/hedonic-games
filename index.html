        <span id="playerExplanation">
          Explanation:
          <span id="friendOriented">
            A player is friend-oriented if she tries to maximize friends and, in the case of a tie, minimize enemies.
            This preference relation is defined by the score function
            \[score_i^{FO}(A) = n | A \cap F_i | - | A \cap E_i | .\]
            Introduced in [DBHS2006].
          </span>
          <span id="enemyOriented">
            A player is enemy-oriented if she tries to minimize enemies and, in the case of a tie, maximize friends.
            This preference relation is defined by the score function
            \[score_i^{EO}(A) = | A \cap F_i | - n | A \cap E_i | .\]
            Introduced in [DBHS2006].
          </span>
          <span id="selfishFirst">
            A player is selfish-first if she uses her own preferences first and only uses her friends' preferences to break ties.
            This preference relation is defined by the score function
            \[ score_i^{SF}(A) = n^5 score_i^{FO}(A) + \sum_{a \in A \cap F_i} \frac{score_a^{FO}(A)}{|A \cap F_i|} .\]
            Introduced in [NRRRS2016].
          </span>
          <span id="equalTreatment">
            A player is equal-treatment if she puts equal weight on her own opinion and each friend's opinion.
            This preference relation is defined by the score function
            \[ score_i^{EQ}(A) = \sum_{a \in A \cap F_i \cup \{i\}} \frac{score_a^{FO}(A)}{|A \cap F_i \cup \{i\}|} .\]
            Introduced in [NRRRS2016].
          </span>
          <span id="altruisticTreatment">
            A player is altruistic-treatment if she uses her friends' preferences first and only uses her own preferences to break ties.
            This preference relation is defined by the score function
            \[ score_i^{AL}(A) = score_i^{FO}(A) + n^5 \sum_{a \in A \cap F_i} \frac{score_a^{FO}(A)}{|A \cap F_i|} .\]
            Introduced in [NRRRS2016].
          </span>
          <span id="fractional">
            In fractional hedonic games, a player's score of a coalition is the average of her scores of the players in it.
            Scores could be anything, but this simulator only allows scores that are simple and symmetric.
            \[ score_i^{FR}(A) = |A \cap F_i| / |A| .\]
            Introduced in [ABH2014].
          </span>
          <span id="additive">
            In additively seperable hedonic games, a node's score of a coalition is the sum of her scores of the players in it.
            In unweighted, undirected graphs, this is simple the degree of the node in the coalition.
            \[ score_i^{AS}(A) = |A \cap F_i| .\]
            I don't know when/where additively seperable hedonic games were introduced. If you know, then please email me!

    <h3> What is a hedonic game? </h3>
    <h4> Basic idea </h4>

    <p>
    You have a set of people which for some reason needs to split into groups.
    The people are called <i>players</i> and the groups are called <i>coalitions</i>.
    Maybe the set of people is your kindergarten class and they need to split up so each group can build a lego tower.
    A player might really want to be in some coalitions, but not in others.
    These are the player's <i>preferences</i>.
    Once the whole set of players is split into coalitions, it's called a <i>partition</i> or a <i>coalition formation</i>.
    <b>Hedonic games are the study of how people cooperate and form groups together and when partitions are stable and when partitions fall apart. </b>
    </p>

    <p> More at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_game">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

    <p> Hedonic games were independently introduced in [BKS2001] and [BJ2002]. </p>

    <h4> Notation </h4>

    <p>
    \(N\) is the set of players, \(n = |N|\) is the number of players, and \(\Gamma\) is a partition of \(N\).
    Usually, \(A \subseteq N\) is a coalition and \(a\) is a player in \(A\).
    And \(i\) is a player from anywhere in \(N\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If some player \(i\) would rather be in coalition \(A\) than coalition \(B\), then we say \(A >_i B\).
    In principle, \(i\)'s preferences are defined by listing all the subsets of \(N\) which contain \(i\) in order of decreasing desirability.
    But that would take tons of computer memory or paper and ink, so we mainly focus on hedonic games which are <i>compactly representable</i>.
    This means that there is some concise way of describing each player's preferences over the possible coalitions.
    Sometimes that means you have a <i>score function</i> which takes a player and a coalition as input and outputs a real number; the larger the number the more that player likes that coalition.
    Once you know the score functions, you can concisely say that \(A >_i B\) if and only if \(score_i(A) > score_i(B)\).
    </p>

    <p> Most of the notation here is from [NRRRS2016]. Other stuff I added to make it more programmer-friendly.</p>
